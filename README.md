# glucose
A Open Source Smart Watch Ecosystem.

### 1. Background

My father has diabetes, which essentially means his pancreas is operating on manual (hard) mode 24/7. A healthy pancreas not only produces insulin, which helps convert glucose in the bloodstream into energy, but it also regulates glucose production, instructing the liver to release glucose into the bloodstream when blood sugar levels are too low. A person with diabetes has to manage without these natural regulatory mechanisms, and low blood sugar can become a medical emergency if left untreated.

We are fortunate to have access to life-changing technologies like MEMS sensors, ultra-low power microcontrollers, and more. These advancements empower us to create solutions that address this problem.
Another critical point is the frequency with which someone with diabetes checks their blood glucose levels throughout the day. It’s like having an unfinished task lingering in the back of your mind all day, every day, which can lead to fatigue and burnout. If I could reduce the effort or time required to check blood glucose levels—or even better, provide a haptic alert at the right moments so that manual checks aren’t necessary—it could significantly improve quality of life.

During my M.Tech (Master of Technology) course, I conducted a literature survey and found that many smartwatches offer a plethora of features. They come with numerous shiny features and application notifications, are beautifully designed, but are often too distracting for elderly individuals, especially while they're at work. Additionally, they don’t provide a reliable or clear view of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data. What we need is something simple. 

### 2. Project Requirements

    • Simple – doesn't require a ton of effort to configure.
    • Cost-efficient – adds only the necessary functionality to keep costs low. 
    • Modular design – Each component and section of the hardware is designed in a way that makes it easy to replace.
    • Open source – All hardware, software, and firmware are open source under the GNU GPL v3 license. 
    • Ecosystem – Build an ecosystem and libraries for displays, haptic feedback, sensors, and other hardware to support the maximum number of hardware resources.  

### 3. Project Roadmap

- PHASE 1 – Selection of component based on requirements.  
- PHASE 2 – Develop a prototype and test all functionalities. 
- PHASE 3 – Build the PCB and firmware after completing the prototype.
- PHASE 4 – Final assembly of hardware.
- PHASE 5 – Develop Android and iOS application.
